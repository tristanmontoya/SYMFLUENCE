# NOTE: This module is licensed Apache-2.0, NOT GPL-3.0 like the rest of
# SYMFLUENCE. It is the extraction-bound acquisition-backend contract
# (destined for the standalone ``symfluence-data-interface`` package); a
# permissive license lets third-party backend authors implement against it
# without inheriting GPL obligations. Implementations choose their own license.

"""AcquisitionBackend protocol contract (Phase A).

The formal, versioned contract under which native and community data
acquisition are co-equal backends (design: ``acquisition_backend_protocol.md``,
ACCEPTED). Backends DECLARE what they can serve (:class:`DatasetCapability`)
and what they produced (:class:`AcquisitionResult`); nothing downstream ever
sniffs files again.

EXTRACTION CONSTRAINT (hard, guard-tested)
------------------------------------------
This module is destined for extraction into a tiny standalone
``symfluence-data-interface`` package at contract v1.0. It must therefore
import **only the Python standard library** (pydantic is permitted by the
design but not currently needed). No ``symfluence.*`` import may occur here,
directly or transitively — enforced by
``tests/conformance/test_extraction_readiness.py``, which executes this file
in an isolated subprocess with all ``symfluence`` imports blocked.

This module (with ``errors.py``) is licensed **Apache-2.0**, not GPL-3.0 — a
permissive interface so third-party backends can target the contract without
inheriting GPL obligations. The extracted package carries the same license.

WINDOW SEMANTICS (normative, conformance item 4)
------------------------------------------------
``AcquisitionRequest.window`` is a **half-open UTC interval** ``[start, end)``:
every delivered timestep ``t`` must satisfy ``start <= t < end``, interpreted
in UTC. Timezone-naive timestamps on a delivered time axis ARE UTC by
definition of this contract; tz-aware timestamps must convert into the window.
Rationale: USGS NWIS treats its ``endDT`` request parameter as *inclusive* of
the end day, so native and community acquisitions of the same nominal window
disagreed on whether the final boundary bin belonged to the delivery — the
boundary-bin discrepancy surfaced by the USGS parity work. A single documented
inclusivity rule turns that class of silent off-by-one into a conformance
failure (``tests/conformance/test_window_bbox_semantics.py``).

BBOX SEMANTICS (normative, conformance item 4)
----------------------------------------------
``AcquisitionRequest.bbox`` is ``(lat_min, lon_min, lat_max, lon_max)``. The
delivered grid must cover the requested box up to a **one-native-pixel
tolerance per edge**: each edge of the delivered extent (outermost cell
centers ± half a native pixel) must lie within one native pixel of the
requested edge. Outward snapping to the native pixel grid — e.g. the DEM
tile-merge clip in ``data/acquisition/handlers/dem.py``, whose rasterio merge
aligns the requested bounds outward to the source pixel grid — and
cell-center subsetting (delivering only cells whose centers fall inside the
box) are both within tolerance; a larger shortfall or overshoot is a
conformance failure.
