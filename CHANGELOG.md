## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-07

Archival release accompanying the SYMFLUENCE paper series
("Out-standing in Every Field", "The Registry as Social Contract",
"From Configuration to Prediction"; Eythorsson et al., 2026, Water
Resources Research, submitted). First release archived on Zenodo via the
GitHub integration.

### Added
- **Citation metadata**: `CITATION.cff` (GitHub "Cite this repository") and
  `.zenodo.json` (Zenodo deposit metadata) with the full author list and
  ORCIDs (#269).
- Guard test validating every shipped paper calibration config against the
  strict config schema.

### Changed
- **Paper supplementary configs trimmed to the final manuscript** (#268):
  removed the four cut experiments (decision ensemble, sensitivity analysis,
  large-sample and large-domain Iceland calibration), reduced the forcing
  ensemble to the four reported products (ERA5, RDRS, AORC, CONUS404), and
  kept only the 130 fixed-seed (42) calibration combinations the paper
  reports; all READMEs updated to the manuscript's section and figure
  numbering.

### Fixed
- Shipped calibration configs for the five JAX-native models (HBV, HEC-HMS,
  SAC-SMA, TOPMODEL, Xinanjiang) failed strict validation due to stale keys
  from older plugin schemas (`initial_params`; HBV also `smoothing`,
  `smoothing_factor`) and could not be loaded; the stale keys are removed
  (85 configs).
- Paper-config seed guard repointed after the #268 trim removed the config
  it loaded (#270).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-14

> **Note**: Versions 0.8.0–0.9.0 were tagged and published without CHANGELOG
> entries. This section documents the changes since the v0.9.0 release; the
> 0.8.x/0.9.0 history is not reconstructed here.

### Added
- **Canonical forcing contract (CFIF)**: a single canonical forcing reader keyed
  to CF standard names (CFIF) that model preprocessors consume through one path,
  with automatic resampling of the source to each model's cadence. Adopted by
  SWAT, Wflow, IGNACIO, LISFLOOD, CWatM, PCR-GLOBWB, RHESSys, CLM-ParFlow, and mHM.
- **Model-ready data store for attributes and observations**: new attributes
  reader plus observation/streamflow loaders that source from the model-ready
  store. SUMMA soil/land class and HYPE GeoData (soil/land/elevation) now read
  from the store; `StreamflowMetrics` and the remaining calibration loaders are
  routed through it.
- **Windows binary builds** for many models — WATFLOOD (bundled Waterloo CHARM
  prebuilt), ParFlow, CLM-ParFlow, PRMS, VIC, PIHM, mHM, WRF-Hydro, and glacier —
  via MinGW/MSYS2 POSIX shims and CMake/NetCDF wiring.
- **WATFLOOD**: full Unix and Windows source builds; CHARM runs on the datastore;
  parallel-calibration plumbing.
- **GSFLOW**: datastore-driven inputs and a distributed-groundwater option.
- **mHM**: CARRA forcing support and distributed-morphology (MPR) mode.
- WATFLOOD and GSFLOW standalone postprocessors registered.

### Changed
- **Agent interface simplified to a launcher.** `symfluence agent launch` now hands
  off to an installed coding-agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, ...), primed with
  the SYMFLUENCE skills, instead of running a bespoke in-house LLM agent. It detects
  the CLI on `PATH` and uses whichever API key is set (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`); override with `SYMFLUENCE_AGENT_CLI`, skip
  skill materialization with `SYMFLUENCE_NO_SKILLS`. The skills now ship inside the
  package. *(net ~ −7,000 LOC)*
- **Config schema canonicalization (toward 1.0)**: promoted data-handler,
  HYPE/NGEN/FUSE/GR/mizuRoute/path, multi-gauge, optimizer/evaluator, and
  parameter-bounds flat keys to typed Pydantic fields; `RECOGNIZED_FLAT_KEYS` is
  now closed; the `state` and `data_assimilation` sections are wired into the
  flat-key transform; IGNACIO/GNN/LSTM schemas reconciled with the registered
  ones. Strict config-key validation is enforced and dogfooded on shipped configs.
- Documentation: root `ARCHITECTURE.md` at-a-glance, an ADR practice with the
  initial ADR set, and a threat model (`docs/security.md`).
- Evaluation: unified catchment-area resolution between trial and final-eval
  metrics (resolves the FUSE final-eval KGE divergence).
- Performance: RTI review item 20 hot-spots — rasterio hoist, Julian-date
  vectorization, coastal-partition rewrite — plus a CLI performance gate.
- Core layering restored: no `core` → upper-layer imports (RTI item 19).

### Fixed
- **Data acquisition**: MERIT-Basins region table and dead-host download; Daymet
  gridded OPeNDAP route (descending y, DAP2); HRRR LCC-grid windowing; CERRA
  longwave variable name; NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 synthetic-airpres survival and hardening;
  DEM merge pixel-grid snap; MSWEP remote path and default version; SMHI
  skip-if-raw-exists guard; EM-Earth S3 handler (403 visibility, credentials,
  month window); WSC GeoMet paging corruption and NLDAS-2 v2.0 variable names;
  USGS NWIS gauge-local → UTC timestamps; GRACE atomic `.part` downloads.
- **HYPE**: clone over `https://` with retry, replacing the deprecated
  `git://` SourceForge transport that intermittently broke nightly and release
  builds.
- **CLM** build: NetCDF library symlinks for PIO (Debian multiarch), git
  `safe.directory` re-assert after HOME change, `mpi-serial` pin, and Perl
  `XML::LibXML` install.
- Hardcoded `*3600` hourly-conversion bugs in the Wflow and IGNACIO forcing paths.
- **Windows builds**: WATFLOOD DLL staging, PIHM `timegm` guard, ParFlow
  `mkdir`/path compatibility, PRMS NetCDF path quoting and `gnu17`, VIC version
  macros, mHM NetCDF detection, and WRF-Hydro checkout.
- **Glacier**: earthaccess auth for NSIDC, RGI region-name transform, and
  coldstart fixes.
- **PRMS**: resilience-handler tracebacks (`exc_info=True`) and HRU parameters
  driven from the datastore.
- SWAT preprocessor registered via `core.registries.R` to avoid a circular import.

### Removed
- **Deprecated `register*` decorator registry API** — registration is now
  R-facade only. *(breaking)*
- **Deprecated `*Postprocessor` spelling aliases** — use `*PostProcessor`.
  *(breaking; external plugins must update)*
- **HYDROGEOSPHERE** model stub. *(breaking)*
- The **CalMIP** example stub.
- **DPE** (differentiable PE) and other dead/external config keys; shipped
  configs curated accordingly.
- **The bespoke in-house LLM agent** (`symfluence.agent` internals) and the
  optional `[llm]`/`openai` dependency — replaced by the launcher above.
  `symfluence agent start`/`run` are deprecated aliases for `launch`. *(breaking:
  the agent now requires an external coding-agent CLI)*

### CI / Release
- `release-binaries`: build MODFLOW 6 from source on Linux, build ngen on
  Linux/macOS, skip CLM on Windows (ESMF/CIME on MinGW unsupported), close
  presence-check holes and surface failed optional builds, and don't clobber the
  latest release on a tagless `workflow_dispatch`.
- Strict config-key validation dogfooded on shipped configs (kept out of the
  lint job, which has no `symfluence` install).
- Require the `PostProcessor`-spelling plugin releases.

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **HPC file-locking workaround**: Added tempfile fallback (attempt 4) to ERA5
  NetCDF writer for parallel filesystems (Lustre/GPFS/BeeGFS) where HDF5
  `fcntl()` locking fails even with `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE`. Writes to
  `$TMPDIR` first, then moves the file to the target path.
- **mizuRoute Makefile build**: Collapse multi-line `LIBNETCDF` before appending
  RPATH flags to avoid breaking backslash continuation (caused "missing separator"
  errors on CI).
- **ngen linker (expat)**: Detect system UDUNITS2 via `pkg-config`/`ldconfig`
  (not just explicit env var) so `-lexpat` is added for XML symbol resolution.
- **Wflow calibration**: Fix snow parameters, routing, and unit conversion issues.
  Add Oudin PET, log-transform bounds, and sub-daily resampling support.
- **FUSE preprocessing**: Make streamflow observations optional.
- **MPI launcher**: Add fallback when preferred launcher fails; prefer `mpirun`
  over `srun` for launcher detection.

### Added
- SPDX license headers on all source files.
- Coverage tracking in cross-platform CI workflow.
- Unit tests for NGEN, JFUSE, HYPE model runners and configs.
- Unit tests for core modules (file_utils, validation, path_resolver).
- Unit tests for `_safe_to_netcdf` fallback chain.
- WATFLOOD: Expand calibration to 16 parameters with tests.
- Bow River preset and default `DEM_SOURCE` to Copernicus.
- Config-hash stage invalidation for workflow orchestrator.

  ```

- **HBV Sub-Daily Parameter Scaling**
  - Implemented exact exponential scaling for recession coefficients (K0, K1, K2)
  - Formula: `k_sub = 1 - (1 - k_daily)^(dt/24)` replaces linear approximation
  - Eliminates ~5-13% error in recession behavior at sub-daily timesteps
  - Flux rate parameters (CFMAX, PERC) continue to use linear scaling
  - Added `FLUX_RATE_PARAMS` and `RECESSION_PARAMS` constants

- **MESH Preprocessing Consolidation**
  - Moved configuration defaults to dedicated `config_defaults.py`
  - Streamlined `config_generator.py` and `meshflow_manager.py`
  - Expanded `parameter_fixer.py` with robust parameter handling
  - Updated NALCMS to CLASS land cover mapping (wetland, snow/ice corrections)
  - Added unit conversion utilities for forcing data
  - Improved logging (replaced debug prints with proper logger calls)

- **FLUXCOM ET Acquisition Rework**
  - Replaced stub ICOS downloader with fully functional `_download_from_icos()` using ICOS Carbon Portal metadata API
  - Smart variable matching (exact name, then substring, then fallback)
  - Automatic unit conversion (W/m2, mm/hr, mm/day)
  - Nearest-neighbor fallback for basins smaller than the grid cell

- **MODIS ET Acquisition Improvements**
  - Spatial subsetting via sinusoidal projection for large tiles with small domains
  - Improved special-value masking (all MODIS QC codes, not just fill value)
  - SDS name matching now tries exact match before substring search

- **Reporting Module Cleanup**
  - Simplified plotter implementations
  - Improved shapefile handling

- **Example Notebooks — Typed Config Migration**
  - Migrated notebooks 02a–03b from legacy `yaml.safe_load` + flat dict pattern to `SymfluenceConfig.from_minimal()` typed config API
  - All 9 example notebooks (01a–04b) now use the same typed, validated, frozen config pattern
  - Removed MAF-specific language from all example notebooks; acquisition comments now reference `DATA_ACCESS: 'cloud'` or `'maf'` config setting
  - Fixed pre-existing bugs: 02a `NameError` on config access, 03b `cf.managers` wrong variable name, 03b config overwrite bug, 03b outdated CLI syntax

### Fixed
- MESH lumped mode routing: switched from `run_def` to `noroute` mode to correctly preserve lower-zone baseflow (`wf_lzs`); `run_def` in MESH 1.5.6 bypasses `STGGW` storage, causing zero baseflow
- Traceback handling in MESH postprocessor
- Added missing `pydantic` runtime dependency to `pyproject.toml`
- Fixed invalid escape sequences in `__init__.py` warning filters for Python 3.12+ compatibility
- CI pipeline now correctly fails on unit/integration test regressions (removed `|| true` from pytest invocations)

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive sub-daily simulation section to HBV model guide
- Documented parameter scaling approaches (exact vs linear)
- Added validation methodology for sub-daily implementations

### Migration Guide

## [0.5.2] - 2025-11-12

### Major: Formal Initial Release with End-to-End CI Validation

**This release marks the first fully reproducible SYMFLUENCE workflow with continuous integration.**

### Added
- **End-to-End CI Pipeline (Example Notebook 2a Equivalent)**
  Integrated a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that builds, validates, and runs SYMFLUENCE automatically on every commit to `main`.
  - Compiles all hydrologic model dependencies (TauDEM, mizuRoute, FUSE, NGEN).
  - Validates MPI, NetCDF, GDAL, and HDF5 environments.
  - Executes key steps (`setup_project`, `create_pour_point`, `define_domain`, `discretize_domain`, `model_agnostic_preprocessing`, `run_model`, `calibrate_model`, `run_benchmarking`).
  - Confirms reproducible outputs under `SYMFLUENCE_DATA_DIR/domain_Bow_at_Banff`.
  - Runs both wrapper (`./symfluence`) and direct Python entrypoints equivalently.

### Changed
- Updated `external_tools_config.py` to include automatic path resolution for TauDEM binaries (e.g., `moveoutletstostrms → moveoutletstostreams`).
- Expanded logging and run summaries for CI visibility.
- Protected `main` branch to require successful CI validation before merge.

### Notes
This release formalizes SYMFLUENCE's **reproducibility framework**, guaranteeing that all supported workflows can be rebuilt and validated automatically on clean systems.
