"""Registry-driven contract sweep — every registered component, implicitly.

The framework's source of truth for "what components exist" is the unified
registry (``symfluence.core.registries.R``), not any hand-maintained list.  This
module enumerates that registry at collection time and asserts a *contract* for
every entry, so a malformed or drifted registration fails the build the moment
it lands — without anyone writing a per-component test.

What it guarantees, for each class-based component registry:

* **Resolvable** — a lazy registration imports cleanly (optional-dependency
  models that aren't installed are *skipped*, not failed — the jFUSE/cFUSE
  pattern, generalized).
* **Is a class** — the registry stores classes; the caller instantiates.
* **Concrete** — no leftover ``@abstractmethod``, i.e. the class can actually be
  instantiated.  (This is what catches a model that subclasses a base but
  forgets to implement a required hook.)
* **Subclasses its base** — or is on a small, documented allow-list of
  standalone duck-typed classes, so *new* drift is blocked while existing
  intentional exceptions are recorded.
* **Exposes the expected methods** — a duck-typed safety net that also covers
  the allow-listed standalone classes.

Plus two model-level completeness guards driven by ``R.registered_models()`` and
``R.validate_model()``:

* every model that has a *runner* also has a *preprocessor* (a real invariant);
* the set of *incomplete* models matches a documented baseline, so a model can
  never silently lose a registered component.

Design note: parametrize IDs are built from ``reg.keys()``, which does **not**
resolve lazy imports — collection stays cheap and import-safe.  Resolution (and
the optional-dependency skip) happens inside each test body.
